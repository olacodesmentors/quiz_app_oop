# A Quiz Game

Quiz game is an interactive command-line application that asks a user  questions, and the user selects true or false. The application tells the user if their answer is correct or wrong, shows their score and asks the next question, until we are out of questions, then we print out the final result and the game ends.

```bash
>>> Q.1 A slug blood is green. (True/False)

if answer is correct

>>> You got it right
>>> The correct answer is True 
>>> Your current score is: 1/1

if answer was incorrect

>>> That\'s wrong
>>> The correct answer is True 
>>> Your current score is: 1/2

then prompt the next question

```
